    <h2>Cooking steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature around 190°C</li>
        <li>Prepare the Ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>Cook the lasagne sheets according to the package instructions until they're al dente.
                    Drain and lay them out flat on parchment paper or a clean kitchen towel to prevent sticking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prepare your sauce of choice and any fillings you'll be using.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Grate or slice your cheese (mozzarella, Parmesan, and ricotta) as needed.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the Layers:
            <ul>
                <li>Start by spreading a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of your baking dish to prevent sticking</li>
                <li>Layer the lasagne sheets over the sauce, covering the bottom of the dish</li>
                <li>Spread a layer of sauce over the lasagne sheets, followed by a layer of cheese and any fillings</li>
                <li>Repeat the layering process until you've used all your ingredients, finishing with a layer of sauce and cheese on top</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bake the Lasagne:
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil to trap moisture and prevent the cheese from burning</li>
                <li>Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 30-45 minutes, or until the lasagne is bubbly and heated through</li>
                <li>Remove the foil during the last few minutes of baking to allow the cheese to brown</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Rest and Serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Once baked, let the lasagne rest for a few minutes before slicing.
                    This allows it to set and makes it easier to serve.
                </li>
                <li>Garnish with fresh herbs if desired, then slice and serve hot</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy: Serve your delicious lasagne alongside a fresh salad and some crusty bread for a satisfying meal</li>
    </ol>
